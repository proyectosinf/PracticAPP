/**
 *  Destinations can be grouped into a nested graph to modularize a particular flow in your appâ€™s UI.
 *  An example of this could be a self-contained login flow.
 *  The nested graph encapsulates its destinations.
 *  As with the root graph, a nested graph must have a destination identified as the
 *  start destination by its route. This is the destination that is navigated to
 *  when you navigate to the route associated with the nested graph.
